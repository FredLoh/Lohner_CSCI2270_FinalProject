# Lohner/Rhoda CSCI 2270 FinalProjet

##Final Project for Data Structures

###Using a Trie to order a list of the most popular names on Facebook depending on different inputs.

Given a list of 100 names we will use a Trie in order to have the most efficient method possible of both counting and being able to use differerent functions (Most popular name starting with a certain letter, etc.).  Although the list of names we will use will be small by comparison to a real list from facebook, we still believe that we will be able to obtain a more optimal computational time by using a Trie instead of another Data Structure.

Team is composed of Frederik Lohner and Chris Rhoda.
